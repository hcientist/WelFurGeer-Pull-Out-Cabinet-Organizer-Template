  <h1>WelFurGeer Pull-Out Cabinet Organizer Template</h1>
  <main>
    <p>I bought <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://a.co/d/4h0Hs4c">this lovely thing on amazon</a>, but unfortunately it did not come with a template... so I made one.</p>

      <p>
        If you print <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="WelFurGeer-Pull-Out-Cabinet-Organizer-Template.pdf" download>these 4 pages üìù</a> and overlap them where indicated,
        it'll show you where to drill and that the total space this thing occupies is: 14" wide, 21 3/32" deep. For what it's
        worth, the floor/shelf onto which you're mounting this need be only 20 15/32" deep because when fully closed, the
        front of the drawer overhangs the mounting bracket by 5/8".
