# WelFurGeer-Pull-Out-Cabinet-Organizer-Template

I bought [this lovely thing on amazon](https://a.co/d/4h0Hs4c), but unfortunately it did not come with a template... so I made one.

If you print [these 4 pages üìù](WelFurGeer-Pull-Out-Cabinet-Organizer-Template.pdf) and overlap them where indicated, it'll show you where to drill and that the total space this thing occupies is: 14" wide, 21 3/32" deep. For what it's worth, the floor/shelf onto which you're mounting this need be only 20 15/32" deep because when fully closed, the front of the drawer overhangs the mounting bracket by 5/8".
